# wskdb: The OpenWhisk Debugger

For documenation on the client, consult [here](client/README.md).

** Disclaimer **

According to the author of the debugger, Nick Mitchell, the debugger currently requires * Node 6 to 6.2 *.

* Anything higher than 6.3 won't work. *

The community would welcome someone who can help us move this debugger to newer Node versions, 
but Nick indicated there were some known issues that prevented him from doing this without large changes.
